# Assignmen 1 : Raw Data to Feature Space
_Big Data and Machine Learning coursework_

The main goal of this assignment is to extract features from a set of given data (generally from raw data) and construct a feature space or feature spaces (along with subspace as appropriate) to develop and train machine learning models. It helps test your knowledge in the first objective; that is, knowing and transforming your data (Chapters 1, 2, and 3) with feature extraction. It helps you understand the characteristics of data such that correct computational and ML techniques and technologies can be selected to process and analyze the data.
